# ArElectronRepo


**This app was made with Electron.** 

Technology used: several electron packages (npm electron, jquery, font-awesome etc.) were used, the main task was to take screen shot in every minute
 when play button is on, and when play button was turned off no screen shot will be taken. coding and designing was performed by me.
